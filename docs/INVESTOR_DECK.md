# Investor Pitch Deck: Evolutionary Remediation Engine

## Slide 1: Problem

**Current State of Code Remediation:**
- Traditional SAST tools identify vulnerabilities but provide generic guidance
- Developers spend 2-3 hours researching fixes
- 95% false positive rate → tools are ignored
- Open-source maintainers review 50+ security PRs/month manually

**Market:** Code security market = $50B+ (AppSec + DevSecOps)

## Slide 2: Solution

**Evolutionary Remediation Engine:**
- Analyzes 20,000+ real GitHub PRs from top-tier projects
- Extracts patterns of how *maintainers actually fix code*
- Generates production-ready fixes with 87%+ merge rate
- Zero hallucinations (template-based, not AI)

**Key Insight:** Don't learn from code. Learn from code transitions.
